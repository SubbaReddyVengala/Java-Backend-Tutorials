What is JDK?
------------

JDK is an abbreviation for Java Development Kit which includes all the tools, executables, and binaries required to compile, 
debug, and execute a Java Program is platform dependent i.e. there are separate installers for Windows, Mac, and Unix systems.
JDK includes both JVM and JRE and is entirely responsible for code execution. It is the version of JDK that represents a version of Java.

What is JRE?
------------

JRE is a Java Runtime Environment which is the implementation of JVM i.e. the specifications that are defined in JVM are implemented and create a corresponding 
environment for the execution of code. JRE comprises mainly Java binaries and other classes to execute the program like JVM which physically exists.

What is JVM?
------------

JVM is the abbreviation for Java Virtual Machine which is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java byte code can be executed
It is JVM which is responsible for converting Byte code to machine-specific code. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to
Java bytecode. The JVM performs the mentioned tasks: Loads code, Verifies code, Executes code, and Provides runtime environment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM

Following are the important differences between JDK, JRE, and JVM −


JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit to develop applications in Java. In addition to JRE, JDK also contains number of development tools (compilers,
JavaDoc, Java Debugger etc.).	

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the implementation of JVM and is defined as a software package that provides Java class libraries, along with Java Virtual Machine 
(JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java programming.	

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that is platform-dependent and has three notions as a specification, a document that describes requirement of JVM
implementation, implementation, a computer program that meets JVM requirements, and instance, an implementation that executes Java byte code provides a runtime environment for executing Java byte code.


2 Prime functionality :

	JDK : JDK is primarily used for code execution and has prime functionality of development.	

        JRE : On other hand JRE is majorly responsible for creating environment for code execution.	

        JVM : JVM on other hand specifies all the implementations and responsible to provide these implementations to JRE.


3 Platform Independence	:

       JDK : JDK is platform dependent i.e for different platforms different JDK required.	

       JRE : Like of JDK JRE is also platform dependent.	

       JVM : JVM is platform independent.


4 Tools	:

       JDK : As JDK is responsible for prime development so it contains tools for developing, debugging and monitoring java application.	

       JRE : On other hand JRE does not contain tools such as compiler or debugger etc. Rather it contains class libraries and other supporting files that JVM
       requires to run the program.	
       JVM : JVM does not include software development tools.


5 Implementation : 
      JDK : JDK = Java Runtime Environment (JRE) + Development tools	

      JRE : JRE = Java Virtual Machine (JVM) + Libraries to run the application	
  
      JVM : JVM = Only Runtime environment for executing the Java byte code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, barking, eating. 
An object is an instance of a class.

Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.

Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions
are executed.

Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.

Java Identifiers:
-------------------
All Java components require names. Names used for classes, variables, and methods are called identifiers.

In Java, there are several points to remember about identifiers. They are as follows −

All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character ($) or an underscore (_).

After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.

A keyword cannot be used as an identifier.

Most importantly, identifiers are case sensitive.

Examples of legal identifiers: age, $salary, _value, __1_value.

Examples of illegal identifiers: 123abc, -salary.

Java Variables
---------------

A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type.

Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.

There are two types of data types in Java: primitive and non-primitive.

Variable
---------
A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of the memory location. It is a combination of "vary + able" which means its value can be changed.

int data=50;//Here data is variable  

Types of Variables
------------------
There are three types of variables in Java:

local variable
instance variable
static variable

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8459cc6f-2d2f-40fa-a995-aebd56419758)

1) Local Variable
------------------
A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't even aware that the variable exists.

A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.

Example of Local Variable

Example
//defining a Local Variable  
int num = 10;  
System.out.println(" Variable: " + num); 

Output:
Variable: 10

2) Instance Variable
   ----------------
A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance variable. It is not declared as static.

It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances.

Example of Instance Variable
---------------------------
Example
          
public class InstanceVariableDemo {  
    //Defining Instance Variables  
    public String name;  
    public int age=19;  
 //Creadting a default Constructor initializing Instance Variable  
    public InstanceVariableDemo()  
    {  
        this.name = "Deepak";  
    }  
}  

public class Main{  
    public static void main(String[] args)  
    {  
        // Object Creation  
       InstanceVariableDemo obj = new InstanceVariableDemo();  
        System.out.println("Student Name is: " + obj.name);  
        System.out.println("Age: "+ obj.age);  
    }  
} 

Output:
-------
Student Name is: Deepak
Age: 19

3) Static variable
 -----------------
A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.

Example Static variable
-----------------------

Example
class Student{  
    //static variable  
   static int age;  
} 

public class Main{  
   public static void main(String args[]){  
       Student s1 = new Student();  
       Student s2 = new Student();  
       s1.age = 24;  
       s2.age = 21;  
       Student.age = 23;  
       System.out.println("S1\'s age is: " + s1.age);  
       System.out.println("S2\'s age is: " + s2.age);  
   }  
}   

Output:
----------
S1's age is: 23
S2's age is: 23

Explanation:
-------------
In Java, a static variable belongs to the class itself rather than to any individual instance. This means there is only one copy of that variable, regardless of how many objects (instances) of the class you create.

Consider the following points:
-----------------------------
Single Copy:
------------
When you declare static int age in the Student class, there's only one age variable shared by all instances of Student. It doesn't matter whether you refer to it via s1.age, s2.age, or Student.age; they all point to the same memory location.

Modification:
-------------
When you change the value of age using any reference, the change is reflected for all references. For example:

Setting s1.age = 24; makes the shared age 24.
Then, setting s2.age = 21; changes the same shared age to 21.
Finally, Student.age = 23; updates the same variable to 23.
Access Through Instances:
Even though you use s1 and s2 to modify age, they are just ways to access the shared variable. They don't have their own separate age field.

Thus, when you print s1.age and s2.age, both will output 23 because that is the last value assigned to the shared static variable.

This is why using static is helpful when you need a property or method that is common to all objects of a class and should not be duplicated for each instance.

Data Types in Java
-------------------
Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. There are two types of data types in Java:

Primitive data types: 
----------------------
The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.

Non-primitive data types: 
-------------------------
The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

Let's understand in detail about the two major data types of Java in the following paragraphs.

Java Primitive Data Types
-------------------------
In Java language, primitive data types are the building blocks of data manipulation. These are the most basic data types available in Java languag
In Java, there are mainly eight primitive data types and let's understand about them in detail in the following paragraphs.

Java Primitive data types:
-------------------------
boolean data type
byte data type
char data type
short data type
int data type
long data type
float data type
double data type

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/677ffe1e-ad80-4d48-a49f-9b9bd7ad852a)

Boolean Data Type
------------------
In Java, the boolean data type represents a single bit of information with two possible states: true or false. It is used to store the result of logical expressions or conditions. Unlike other primitive data types like int or double, boolean does not have a specific size or range.

Example
boolean a=false;  
boolean b=true;  
System.out.println("a= " + a);  
System.out.println("b= " + b);

Output
------
 a= false
 
 b= true

Note:
-----
For instance, an if statement executes a block of code if the boolean expression evaluates to true, and skips it if the expression is false.

Byte Data Type
--------------
The byte data type in Java is a primitive data type that represents an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a range of values from -128 to 127. Its default value is 0. The byte data type is commonly used when working with raw binary data or when memory conservation is a concern, as it occupies less memory than larger integer types like int or long.

Example
byte a=10;  
byte b=-20;  
System.out.println("a= " + a);  
System.out.println("b= " + b)

Output
 a= 10
 b= -20
 a= 10
 b= -20

Note:
-----
One common use of the byte data type is in reading and writing binary data, such as files or network streams. Since binary data is often represented using bytes, the byte data type provides a convenient way to work with such data.

Short Data Type
---------------
The short data type in Java is a primitive data type that represents a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a range of values from -32,768 to 32,767. Similar to the byte data type, short is used when memory conservation is a concern, but more precision than byte is required. Its default value is 0.

Example
short a=10000;  
short b=-5000;  
System.out.println("a= " + a);  
System.out.println("b= " + b); 

Output

 a= 10000
 b= -5000
 a= 10000
 b= -5000
 
Note:
-----
As with the byte data type, short variables must be explicitly cast when used in expressions with larger integer types to avoid loss of precision.

Int Data Type
--------------
The int data type in Java is a primitive data type that represents a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a range of values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. The int data type is one of the most commonly used data types in Java and is typically used to store whole numbers without decimal points. Its default value is 0.

Example
--------
int a=100000;  
int b=-200000;  
System.out.println("a= " + a);  
System.out.println("b= " + b);  

Output

 a= 100000
 b= -200000

 Note:
 -----
 Int variables can be used in mathematical expressions, assigned to other int variables, and used in conditional statements.

 Long Data Type
 --------------

 The long data type in Java is a primitive data type that represents a 64-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a wider range of values than int, ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Its default value is 0.0F. The long data type is used when int is not large enough to hold the desired value, or when a larger range of integer values is needed.

 Example
long a = 5000000L;    
long b = -6000000L;  
System.out.println("a= " + a);    
System.out.println("b= " + b); 

Output

a= 5000000
b= -6000000
a= 5000000
b= -6000000

Note:
----
The long data type is commonly used in applications where large integer values are required, such as in scientific computations, financial applications, and systems programming. It provides greater precision and a larger range than int, making it suitable for scenarios where int is insufficient

Float Data Type
--------------
The float data type in Java is a primitive data type that represents single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. It can represent a wide range of decimal values, but it is not suitable for precise values such as currency. The float data type is useful for applications where a higher range of values is needed, and precision is not critical.

Example
float f = 234.5f;    
System.out.println("f = " + f);   

Output
f = 234.5

Note:
----
One of the key characteristics of the float data type is its ability to represent a wide range of values, both positive and negative, including very small and very large values. However, due to its limited precision (approximately 6-7 significant decimal digits), it is not suitable for applications where exact decimal values are required.

Double Data Type
-----------------
The double data type in Java is a primitive data type that represents double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point numbers. Its default value is 0.0d. It provides a wider range of values and greater precision compared to the float data type, making it suitable for applications where accurate representation of decimal values is required.

Example
double d = 12.3;    
System.out.println("d = " + d); 

Output
d = 12.3

Note:
-----
One of the key advantages of the double data type is its ability to represent a wider range of values with greater precision compared to float. It can accurately represent values with up to approximately 15-16 significant decimal digits, making it suitable for applications that require high precision, such as financial calculations, scientific computations, and graphics programming.

Char Data Type:
----------------
The char data type in Java is a primitive data type that represents a single 16-bit Unicode character. It can store any character from the Unicode character set, that allows Java to support internationalization and representation of characters from various languages and writing systems.

Example:

char c = 'A';  
System.out.println("c = " + c); 

Output
c = A

Note:
----
The char data type is commonly used to represent characters, such as letters, digits, and symbols, in Java programs. It can also be used to perform arithmetic operations, as the Unicode values of characters can be treated as integers. For example, you can perform addition or subtraction operations on char variables to manipulate their Unicode values.

Non-primitive data types in Java, also known as reference types, refer to objects and arrays rather than the simple, built-in primitives like int or char. Here are some key points about them:

Characteristics
Reference-Based:
---------------
Variables of non-primitive types store memory addresses (references) that point to the actual data (objects) on the heap.

Complex Structures:
------------------
They can contain multiple values and methods, allowing for more complex data structures.

Default Value:
--------------
If not explicitly initialized, non-primitive types default to null.

User-Defined:
------------
You can create your own classes and interfaces, which are non-primitive by nature.

Types of Non-Primitive Data Types
-------------------------------
Classes and Objects:
------------------
Any object created from a class is a non-primitive type. For example, the String class is a non-primitive type:

String greeting = "Hello, World!";
Interfaces:
Variables that refer to an interface are also non-primitive types. They hold references to objects of classes that implement the interface.

Arrays:
--------
Arrays in Java, whether of primitive or non-primitive elements, are themselves non-primitive:


int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};
Student[] students = new Student[10];
Enumerations (Enums):
Enums are special types of classes that define a fixed set of constants:

enum Day { MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY }
Wrapper Classes:
These are classes that encapsulate primitive types (e.g., Integer for int, Double for double). Even though they wrap primitives, they are non-primitive types and provide methods for converting and manipulating values.

Why Use Non-Primitive Types?
--------------------------
Object-Oriented Programming:
---------------------------
They allow you to implement encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Functionality
---------------
Non-primitive types come with built-in methods (e.g., string manipulation methods in the String class) that simplify many programming tasks.

Custom Data Structures:
----------------------
They enable the creation of complex data models by allowing you to define classes with attributes and behaviors.

Operators in Java
-----------------
Operator are an essential part of any programming language. In Java, operator is a symbol that is used to perform operations. For example: +, -, *, / etc. These are essential for performing different types of operations on variables and values. In this section, we will discuss different types of operators used in Java programming.

There are many types of operators in Java which are given below:

Unary Operator,
Arithmetic Operator,
Shift Operator,
Relational Operator,
Bitwise Operator,
Logical Operator,
Ternary Operator and
Assignment Operator.

Java Unary Operator:
--------------------
The Java unary operators require only one operand. Unary operators are used to perform various operations i.e. incrementing/decrementing a value by one, negating an expression and inverting the value of a boolean.

++ : increments a value by one
Pre-increment (++p) : First increments a value by one, then uses the value.
Post-increment (p++) : First uses the value, then increments a value by one.

-- : decrements a value by one
Pre-decrement (--p) : First decrements a value by one, then uses the value.
Post-decrement (p--) : First uses the value, then decrements a value by one.

! : negates an expression
~ : inverts the value of a boolean

Java Unary Operator Example: ++ and --

Example
int x=10;  
System.out.println(x++);//10 (11)  
System.out.println(++x);//12  
System.out.println(x--);//12 (11)  
System.out.println(--x);//10  

Output
10
12
12
10

int a=10;    
int b=10;    
System.out.println(a++ + ++a);//10+12=22    
System.out.println(b++ + b++);//10+11=21    

Java Arithmetic Operators
--------------------------
Java arithmetic operators are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They act as basic mathematical operations.

Java Arithmetic Operator Example

int a=10;    
int b=5;    
System.out.println(a+b);//15    
System.out.println(a-b);//5    
System.out.println(a*b);//50    
System.out.println(a/b);//2    
System.out.println(a%b);//0    

Java Shift Operators:
----------------------
Java shift operator works on the bits of the data. It shifts the bits of the number from left to right or right to left. There are three types of shift operators in Java.

<< : Left Shift Operator (Signed)
>> : Right Shift Operator (Signed)
>>> : Unsigned Right Shift Operator

Java Left Shift Operator
------------------------
The Java left shift operator << is used to shift all of the bits in a value to the left side of a specified number of times.

Java Left Shift Operator Example
--------------------------------

System.out.println(10<<2);//10*2^2=10*4=40  
System.out.println(10<<3);//10*2^3=10*8=80  
System.out.println(20<<2);//20*2^2=20*4=80  
System.out.println(15<<4);//15*2^4=15*16=240  

Java Right Shift Operator
--------------------------
The Java right shift operator >> is used to move the value of the left operand to right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

Java Right Shift Operator Example
---------------------------------
System.out.println(10>>2);//10/2^2=10/4=2  
System.out.println(20>>2);//20/2^2=20/4=5  
System.out.println(20>>3);//20/2^3=20/8=2  

Java Relational Operators
--------------------------
Java relational operators are used to check relationship between two operands such as less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, equal to and not equal to. These operators return boolean values either true or false.

< : Less Than
> : Greater Than
<= : Less Than or Equal to
>= : Greater Than or Equal to
== : Equal to
!= : Not Equal to

Java Relational Operator Example
--------------------------------

int a=10;  
int b=20;  
System.out.println("(a < b) : " + (a<b));  
System.out.println("(a > b) : " + (a>b));  
System.out.println("(a <= b) : " + (a<=b));  
System.out.println("(a >= b) : " + (a>=b));  
System.out.println("(a == b) : " + (a==b));  
System.out.println("(a != b) : " + (a!=b));  

Output:

(a < b) : true
(a > b) : false
(a <= b) : true
(a >= b) : false
(a == b) : false
(a != b) : true

Java AND Operator Example: Logical && and Bitwise 
---------------------------------------------------
The logical && operator does not check the second condition if the first condition is false. It checks the second condition only if the first one is true.

The bitwise & operator always checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.

public class OperatorExample9{    
public static void main(String args[]){    
int a=10;    
int b=5;    
int c=20;    
System.out.println(a<b&&a<c);//false && true = false    
System.out.println(a<b&a<c);//false & true = false    
}}    

Output:

false
false

Java AND Operator Example: Logical && vs Bitwise &
File Name: OperatorExample10.java

public class OperatorExample10{    
public static void main(String args[]){    
int a=10;    
int b=5;    
int c=20;    
System.out.println(a<b&&a++<c);//false && true = false    
System.out.println(a);//10 because second condition is not checked    
System.out.println(a<b&a++<c);//false && true = false    
System.out.println(a);//11 because second condition is checked    
}}    
Output:

false
10
false
11


Java OR Operator Example: Logical || and Bitwise |
The logical || operator does not check the second condition if the first condition is true. It checks the second condition only if the first one is false.

The bitwise | operator always checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.

File Name: OperatorExample11.java

public class OperatorExample11{    
public static void main(String args[]){    
int a=10;    
int b=5;    
int c=20;    
System.out.println(a>b||a<c);//true || true = true    
System.out.println(a>b|a<c);//true | true = true    
//|| vs |    
System.out.println(a>b||a++<c);//true || true = true    
System.out.println(a);//10 because second condition is not checked    
System.out.println(a>b|a++<c);//true | true = true    
System.out.println(a);//11 because second condition is checked    
}}    
Output:

true
true
true
10
true
11

Java Ternary Operator
-----------------------
Java Ternary operator is used as one line replacement for if-then-else statement and used a lot in Java programming. It is the only conditional operator which takes three operands.

Java Ternary Operator Example
-----------------------------------
File Name: OperatorExample12.java

public class OperatorExample12{    
public static void main(String args[]){    
int a=2;    
int b=5;    
int min=(a<b)?a:b;    
System.out.println(min);    
}}    


Output:
2

Java Assignment Operator
---------------------------
Java assignment operator is one of the most common operators. It is used to assign the value on its right to the operand on its left.

Java Assignment Operator Example
-----------------------------------
File Name: OperatorExample14.java

public class OperatorExample14{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
int a=10;  
int b=20;  
a+=4;//a=a+4 (a=10+4)  
b-=4;//b=b-4 (b=20-4)  
System.out.println(a);  
System.out.println(b);  
}}  


Conclusion
------------
Operators are a fundamental part of Java programming, enabling developers to perform various tasks ranging from simple arithmetic to complex bitwise operations. Understanding the different types of operators and their precedence is crucial for writing efficient and effective Java code.
