# ðŸ§© Microservices with Spring Boot

## ðŸ”· 1. What Are Microservices?
Microservices is an architectural style where the application is composed of **independently deployable services**, each focusing on a **specific business capability**.

- Each service runs in its **own process**
- Has its own **database**
- Communicates via **lightweight protocols** (typically REST/HTTP or messaging like Kafka)

---

## ðŸ”· 2. Key Features of Microservices
- **Loose coupling & high cohesion**
- **Independent deployment**
- **Technology polyglot** (different tech stacks possible per service)
- **Resilience & fault isolation**
- **Scalability** (scale services independently)

---

## ðŸ”· 3. Why Spring Boot for Microservices?
- Rapid development with minimal configuration
- Embedded servers (Tomcat/Jetty)
- Seamless integration with Spring Cloud
- Auto-configuration & production-ready via Actuator
- Easy REST API + Database support

## ðŸ”· 4. Essential Components in Spring Boot Microservices

| Component                  | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spring Boot App**       | Core microservice logic                                                     |
| **Spring Cloud Gateway**  | API Gateway for routing/filtering requests                                  |
| **Eureka Server**         | Service registry for discovery                                              |
| **Config Server**         | Centralized external configuration                                          |
| **Feign Client**          | Declarative REST client for inter-service communication                     |
| **Kafka / RabbitMQ**      | Asynchronous message broker                                                 |
| **Zipkin + Sleuth**       | Distributed tracing and correlation IDs                                     |
| **Resilience4j**          | Circuit breaker, retry, fallback                                            |
| **JWT + Spring Security** | Secure endpoints using tokens and roles                                     |

## ðŸ”· 5. Inter-Service Communication

**Synchronous:**
- Using `RestTemplate` or `FeignClient`

**Asynchronous:**
- Using Kafka or RabbitMQ

```java
@FeignClient(name = "order-service")
public interface OrderClient {
   @GetMapping("/orders/user/{id}")
   List<Order> getOrdersByUser(@PathVariable Long id);
}

```
## ðŸ”· 6. Best Practices

- Follow **Single Responsibility Principle** per service  
- Use **DTOs** to decouple internal models  
- Avoid direct database calls between services  
- Implement **centralized logging & tracing**  
- Secure APIs with **JWT/OAuth2**  
- Maintain **backward compatibility** in APIs  

---

## ðŸ”· 7. Challenges in Microservices

- Complex inter-service communication  
- Distributed transactions â†’ solved via **Saga Pattern**  
- Debugging â†’ use **Sleuth + Zipkin**  
- Configuration management â†’ use **Spring Cloud Config**  
- Data consistency â†’ use **event-driven architecture**

## ðŸ”· 9. Common Spring Annotations for Microservices

| Annotation               | Purpose                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `@SpringBootApplication` | Main class to bootstrap the app          |
| `@EnableEurekaClient`    | Register service with Eureka             |
| `@EnableFeignClients`    | Enables Feign client usage               |
| `@EnableDiscoveryClient` | Enables service discovery                |
| `@RestController`        | Marks a class as a REST controller       |

## ðŸ”· Difference Between Monolithic and Microservices

| Feature                   | Monolithic Architecture                                  | Microservices Architecture                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | Single unified application                               | Application composed of small, independent services           |
| **Deployment**            | Entire application deployed as one unit                  | Each service is deployed independently                        |
| **Scalability**           | Scales by cloning the whole app                          | Individual services can be scaled independently               |
| **Technology Stack**      | Typically uses a single tech stack                       | Different services can use different tech stacks              |
| **Development**           | Easy to develop in early stages                          | Suitable for large, complex applications                      |
| **Codebase**              | One large codebase                                       | Multiple smaller codebases (per service)                      |
| **Communication**         | In-process method calls                                  | Lightweight protocols like HTTP/REST, Kafka, gRPC             |
| **Database**              | Single database                                          | Each service manages its own database                         |
| **Fault Isolation**       | A failure can bring down the whole app                   | Failure in one service doesn't affect others                  |
| **Deployment Time**       | Longer due to size of app                                | Faster as only changed services are deployed                  |
| **Testing**               | End-to-end testing is easier                             | Requires service-level and contract testing                   |
| **Team Ownership**        | Multiple teams work on the same codebase                 | Each team owns specific microservices                         |
| **Maintainability**       | Becomes harder as app grows                              | Easier to manage and maintain                                 |
| **Performance Overhead**  | Less (no inter-process communication)                    | Slightly higher due to inter-service communication            |

### âœ… Summary:

- **Monolithic**: Best for small, simple apps. Easy to start, harder to scale.  
- **Microservices**: Best for complex, scalable systems with independent teams.
