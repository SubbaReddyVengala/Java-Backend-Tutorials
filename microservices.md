# 🧩 Microservices with Spring Boot

## 🔷 1. What Are Microservices?
Microservices is an architectural style where the application is composed of **independently deployable services**, each focusing on a **specific business capability**.

- Each service runs in its **own process**
- Has its own **database**
- Communicates via **lightweight protocols** (typically REST/HTTP or messaging like Kafka)

---

## 🔷 2. Key Features of Microservices
- **Loose coupling & high cohesion**
- **Independent deployment**
- **Technology polyglot** (different tech stacks possible per service)
- **Resilience & fault isolation**
- **Scalability** (scale services independently)

---

## 🔷 3. Why Spring Boot for Microservices?
- Rapid development with minimal configuration
- Embedded servers (Tomcat/Jetty)
- Seamless integration with Spring Cloud
- Auto-configuration & production-ready via Actuator
- Easy REST API + Database support

**Synchronous:**
- Using `RestTemplate` or `FeignClient`

**Asynchronous:**
- Using Kafka or RabbitMQ

```java
@FeignClient(name = "order-service")
public interface OrderClient {
   @GetMapping("/orders/user/{id}")
   List<Order> getOrdersByUser(@PathVariable Long id);
}

```
## 🔷 6. Best Practices

- Follow **Single Responsibility Principle** per service  
- Use **DTOs** to decouple internal models  
- Avoid direct database calls between services  
- Implement **centralized logging & tracing**  
- Secure APIs with **JWT/OAuth2**  
- Maintain **backward compatibility** in APIs  

---

## 🔷 7. Challenges in Microservices

- Complex inter-service communication  
- Distributed transactions → solved via **Saga Pattern**  
- Debugging → use **Sleuth + Zipkin**  
- Configuration management → use **Spring Cloud Config**  
- Data consistency → use **event-driven architecture**

## 🔷 Difference Between Monolithic and Microservices

| Feature                   | Monolithic Architecture                                  | Microservices Architecture                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | Single unified application                               | Application composed of small, independent services           |
| **Deployment**            | Entire application deployed as one unit                  | Each service is deployed independently                        |
| **Scalability**           | Scales by cloning the whole app                          | Individual services can be scaled independently               |
| **Technology Stack**      | Typically uses a single tech stack                       | Different services can use different tech stacks              |
| **Development**           | Easy to develop in early stages                          | Suitable for large, complex applications                      |
| **Codebase**              | One large codebase                                       | Multiple smaller codebases (per service)                      |
| **Communication**         | In-process method calls                                  | Lightweight protocols like HTTP/REST, Kafka, gRPC             |
| **Database**              | Single database                                          | Each service manages its own database                         |
| **Fault Isolation**       | A failure can bring down the whole app                   | Failure in one service doesn't affect others                  |
| **Deployment Time**       | Longer due to size of app                                | Faster as only changed services are deployed                  |
| **Testing**               | End-to-end testing is easier                             | Requires service-level and contract testing                   |
| **Team Ownership**        | Multiple teams work on the same codebase                 | Each team owns specific microservices                         |
| **Maintainability**       | Becomes harder as app grows                              | Easier to manage and maintain                                 |
| **Performance Overhead**  | Less (no inter-process communication)                    | Slightly higher due to inter-service communication            |

---

### ✅ Summary:

- **Monolithic**: Best for small, simple apps. Easy to start, harder to scale.  
- **Microservices**: Best for complex, scalable systems with independent teams.

---

### ✅ Flow of Request in Microservices with Spring Boot

1. **Client** sends a request → hits **API Gateway**
2. **Gateway** routes request to appropriate **microservice**
3. **Microservice** handles logic, may call **other services** (via Feign/REST)
4. Services access their **own databases**
5. **Response** travels back to the client through the same path

---

### ✅ Benefits of Using Spring Boot for Microservices

- Fast development with minimal configuration
- Production-ready services with Actuator
- Easy integration with cloud-native components
- Wide community and documentation support
- Supports both synchronous (REST/Feign) and asynchronous (Kafka) communication


## 🔷 API Gateway in Microservices (Spring Cloud Gateway)

### ✅ What is an API Gateway?

An **API Gateway** is a server that acts as a **single entry point** for all client requests. It handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, logging, and response transformation before forwarding the request to backend services.

---

### ✅ Why Use API Gateway in Microservices?

- Simplifies client communication (only one endpoint to call)
- Centralized **authentication and authorization**
- Routes requests to appropriate microservices
- Can apply filters: **logging, retries, circuit breakers**
- Hides internal microservice structure from the client

---

### ✅ Spring Cloud Gateway (SCG)

Spring Cloud Gateway is the preferred **API Gateway** solution from Spring team, built on top of **Project Reactor** and **Spring WebFlux** for non-blocking I/O.

---

### ✅ Core Features of Spring Cloud Gateway

- **Routing**: Based on path, headers, query params, etc.
- **Filters**: Pre and post-processing of requests (e.g., auth, logging)
- **Rate limiting**: Control traffic load
- **Load balancing**: With Eureka or other discovery clients
- **Path rewriting**: Modify incoming URLs before forwarding

---

### ✅ Sample Route Configuration (application.yml)

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: user-service
          uri: lb://USER-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/users/**
        - id: order-service
          uri: lb://ORDER-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/orders/**
```

## 🔷 How API Gateway Works (In-Depth)

An API Gateway serves as the **front-door** to your microservices system. It intercepts all incoming client requests and processes them based on routing rules, filters, and policies.

---

### ✅ 1. Routing

**What it does:**  
Determines **which microservice** should handle a particular request based on routing rules.

**How it works:**
- **Path-based routing**  
  Example: `/users/**` → User Service  
  `/orders/**` → Order Service

- **Header-based routing**  
  Example: `X-Client-Version: v1` → Legacy Service

- **Query param-based routing**  
  Example: `/api/items?type=premium` → Premium Service

**Spring Cloud Gateway YAML Example:**

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: user-service
          uri: lb://USER-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/users/**
        - id: order-service
          uri: lb://ORDER-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/orders/**
```
### ✅ 2. Filtering (Pre & Post)

Filters allow you to **manipulate the request and response**. Filters can be used for logging, authentication, modification, etc.

-   **Pre-filters**: Run before request is routed  
    e.g., Authentication, Logging, Header Injection
    
-   **Post-filters**: Run after service responds  
    e.g., Response Transformation, Metrics Logging
    

**Example in Java:**
```
@Component
public class CustomLoggingFilter implements GlobalFilter {
    @Override
    public Mono<Void> filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain) {
        System.out.println(">>> Pre-Filter: Logging Request");
        return chain.filter(exchange).then(Mono.fromRunnable(() -> {
            System.out.println("<<< Post-Filter: Logging Response");
        }));
    }
}
```
### ✅ 3. Centralized Authentication and Authorization

API Gateway acts as the **security entry point** for all services.

-   Validates JWT/OAuth2 tokens
    
-   Forwards only **authorized requests**
    
-   Prevents exposing individual microservices to external users
    

**Benefits:**

-   Central point of control
    
-   Reduces duplicate auth logic across services

### ✅ 4. Rate Limiting

Prevents a single client or IP from **overloading** the backend system by limiting how many requests they can make in a given time frame.

**Use cases:**

-   Protects services from abuse
    
-   Ensures fair usage across clients
    
```
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: user-service
          uri: lb://USER-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/users/**
          filters:
            - name: RequestRateLimiter
              args:
                redis-rate-limiter.replenishRate: 10
                redis-rate-limiter.burstCapacity: 20
```
### ✅ 5. Load Balancing with Eureka

When integrated with **Eureka Service Discovery**, the API Gateway performs **client-side load balancing**.

-   Uses `lb://SERVICE-NAME` URI to discover available instances
    
-   Routes traffic to healthy instances only
    

**Built-in with Spring Cloud LoadBalancer or Ribbon**
### ✅ 6. Path Rewriting

Sometimes the internal microservice expects a different path than what the client sends.

**Use case:** Hide internal paths or version details

```
filters:
  - RewritePath=/v1/api/(?<segment>.*), /$\{segment}
```
### ✅ 7. Hides Internal Microservice Details

The client:

-   **Only sees the Gateway** URL
    
-   Does **not know** how many services exist
    
-   Can be version-agnostic and simplified
    

Example:

-   Client calls `/api/products`
    
-   Gateway internally routes to `http://product-service/v1/products`


### ✅ 1. **What is API Gateway?**

API Gateway is the **central entry point** for all requests coming into your system. Instead of having clients directly call each microservice, the API Gateway routes and filters all requests and responses.

**Why use it?**

-   Hides internal service URLs
    
-   Adds centralized security (like JWT validation)
    
-   Applies rate limits
    
-   Handles failures with fallbacks
    
-   Performs logging, metrics collection, and response modification
### ✅ 2. **Routing Requests (Spring Cloud Gateway)**

Routing in Spring Cloud Gateway is configured using the `application.yml` file
routes:
  ```
   - id: user-service
    uri: lb://USER-SERVICE
    predicates:
      - Path=/users/**
```
This means:

-   Any request like `/users/1` is **routed to `USER-SERVICE`**.
    
-   `lb://` means it uses **load balancing** via Eureka to pick a healthy instance.
    

You can route based on:

-   URL paths (`/users/**`)
    
-   HTTP headers (`X-Version: 1`)
    
-   Query parameters (`?type=premium`)
### ✅ 3. **JWT Authentication Filter**

The `JwtAuthFilter` is a **custom security filter** applied on incoming requests before routing them.

What it does:

-   Checks if the `Authorization` header contains a token (starting with `Bearer` )
    
-   Rejects the request if no token is present
    
-   In a real-world app, it would decode the token and check if it’s valid (expired or tampered)
    

**Purpose:** To **secure all microservices** through a single filter in the gateway.
### ✅ 4. **Fallback Mechanism**

If a microservice is **down or unresponsive**, the API Gateway uses a **fallback URI** to return a predefined message.

Example:
```
filters:
  - name: CircuitBreaker
    args:
      name: userServiceCB
      fallbackUri: forward:/userServiceFallback

```
This redirects the request to `/userServiceFallback` (a controller method) when the service fails.

**Why it's important:** Prevents total system failure and gives a graceful response.
### ✅ 5. **Service Discovery (Eureka)**

Eureka acts as the **service registry**.

-   Each microservice (user, order, auth) **registers itself** with Eureka.
    
-   The API Gateway and other services use Eureka to **discover instances** dynamically.
    
-   No hardcoding of IPs or ports is needed.
    

**Example in YAML:**
```
eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
```
### ✅ 6. **Dummy JWT Generation (Auth Service)**

The `auth-service` acts like an **identity provider**. It returns a dummy token (in reality, you’d generate a signed JWT with user claims).
```
POST /auth/login
{
  "username": "subba",
  "password": "reddy"
}
```
Response:
```
Bearer dummy-jwt-token
```
**Purpose:** Simulates real login + token generation flow.
### ✅ 7. **User & Order Microservices**

These services are protected via gateway:

-   `GET /users/1` → Routed to `user-service`
    
-   `GET /orders/1` → Routed to `order-service`
    

They are simple REST endpoints that demonstrate how each service:

-   Has **its own controller**
    
-   Runs **on a separate port**
    
-   Is **registered with Eureka**
    

----------

### ✅ 8. **Final Flow (End-to-End)**
```

        // In real life, validate user and generate JWT
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Bearer dummy-jwt-token");
    }

    static class User {
        public String username;
        public String password;
    }
}
```

**application.yml**
```yaml
server:
  port: 8081
spring:
  application:
    name: auth-service

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
```

### ✅ 6. User & Order Services

**UserController.java**
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getUser(@PathVariable String id) {
        return "User with ID: " + id;
    }
}
```

**OrderController.java**
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/orders")
public class OrderController {
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getOrder(@PathVariable String id) {
        return "Order with ID: " + id;
    }
}
```

**application.yml (both)**
```yaml
server:
  port: 808X  # 8082 for user, 8083 for order
spring:
  application:
    name: user-service / order-service

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
```

### 🧠 Explanation of Key Concepts

**What is API Gateway?**
- Central entry point to all microservices
- Handles security, routing, load balancing, and fallbacks

**Routing:**
- Defined using path predicates in `application.yml`
- Load-balanced to healthy service instances via Eureka

**JWT Filter:**
- Validates authorization tokens on each request
- Prevents unauthorized access before reaching microservices

**Fallbacks:**
- Circuit breakers detect failure
- Custom fallback methods give user-friendly error responses

**Service Discovery (Eureka):**
- Dynamically registers and locates microservices
- Removes hardcoded IPs and ports

**Auth Service:**
- Issues a dummy JWT token on login
- In production, this will include user claims and signature

**Microservices:**
- Small services like user-service and order-service expose REST APIs
- They register with Eureka and are routed through API Gateway

**End-to-End Flow:**
1. Client sends request with JWT → API Gateway
2. JWT validated → Route to service → Fallback if down
3. Response sent back to client

---

✅ This is  complete API Gateway + Eureka + JWT + Fallback base project.


### ✅ 1. **Add Rate Limiting (Redis-backed)**

**Why:** Prevent abuse, control traffic per client or API.

**How:**

-   Use `RequestRateLimiter` filter in Spring Cloud Gateway
    
-   Backed by Redis (stores request counts per key)
    

**Includes:**

-   Redis setup
    
-   `application.yml` update
    
-   Rate limiting filter example
    

----------

### ✅ 2. **Write Real JWT Verification Logic**

**Why:** Validate real tokens, ensure secure communication.

**How:**

-   Add JWT secret key in config
    
-   Decode and validate JWT (issuer, signature, expiry, roles)
    
-   Add helper methods for claims extraction
    

**Includes:**

-   JWT utility class
    
-   Updated `JwtAuthFilter` to validate and parse tokens
    
-   Use libraries like `io.jsonwebtoken` (JJWT)
    

----------

### ✅ 3. **Create Docker Compose Setup**

**Why:** Easily run all services with one command (`docker-compose up`)

**How:**

-   Dockerfiles for each service
    
-   `docker-compose.yml` to spin up all containers (gateway, Eureka, auth, user, order, redis)
    

**Includes:**

-   Base images
    
-   Network setup
    
-   Redis and Eureka containers
    

----------

### ✅ 4. **Generate Postman Collection**

**Why:** Quickly test login, API calls with token, fallback

**How:**

-   `POST /auth/login` → get token
    
-   Use token in `Authorization` header
    
-   Test `/users/{id}`, `/orders/{id}`, and fallback
    

**Includes:**

-   `.json` file (import into Postman)
    
-   Environments and pre-request scripts

## 🔷 Scenario-Based API Gateway Interview Questions (for 3 Yrs Experience)

----------

### ✅ 1. **JWT Validation at Gateway**

**🧩 Scenario:**  
You implemented JWT in your microservices. The client sends a request without a valid token.  
**How will your API Gateway detect this, and what should happen?**

**What to Explain:**

-   Use a **custom filter** (`GatewayFilter`) to intercept and validate JWT.
    
-   Return `401 Unauthorized` if token is missing or invalid.
    
-   Only forward valid requests to microservices.
    

----------

### ✅ 2. **Service Is Down (Circuit Breaker + Fallback)**

**🧩 Scenario:**  
`order-service` is down. A client makes a request to `/orders/123`.  
**How does your gateway handle this gracefully without crashing the client?**

**Expected Concepts:**

-   Use Spring Cloud Gateway’s **CircuitBreaker filter** (with Resilience4j or Hystrix).
    
-   Configure a **`fallbackUri`** to return a friendly response (e.g., “Order service is temporarily unavailable”).
    

----------

### ✅ 3. **Rate Limiting a Client**

**🧩 Scenario:**  
One client floods your API with requests. You want to limit it to 5 requests per second.  
**How do you implement this?**

**Key Points:**

-   Use `RequestRateLimiter` filter in gateway.
    
-   Back it with **Redis** (token bucket algorithm).
    
-   Use **KeyResolver** (e.g., based on IP address or user ID).
    

----------

### ✅ 4. **Routing Dynamically Without Hardcoding URLs**

**🧩 Scenario:**  
You have 10 microservices. You don’t want to hardcode each service’s URL in the gateway config.  
**How will you configure routing?**

**Answer:**

-   Enable **Eureka service discovery**.
    
-   Use `spring.cloud.gateway.discovery.locator.enabled=true` → this auto-generates routes using `lb://`.
    

----------

### ✅ 5. **Different Response Based on Route or Version**

**🧩 Scenario:**  
Your frontend hits `/v1/users/123` and `/v2/users/123`. You want to send traffic to two different services.  
**How do you set this up in gateway?**

**What to Explain:**

-   Use **path-based routing** with different service URIs:
    


`predicates:  -  Path=/v1/users/**  →  user-service-v1  -  Path=/v2/users/**  →  user-service-v2` 

----------

### ✅ 6. **Modify or Rewrite Path in Gateway**

**🧩 Scenario:**  
Frontend calls `/api/users/123`, but the backend expects `/users/123`.  
**How do you fix this without changing the frontend?**

**Explain:**

-   Use `RewritePath` filter:
    

`filters:  -  RewritePath=/api/(?<segment>.*),  /$\u003csegment>` 

----------

### ✅ 7. **Logging All Incoming Requests**

**🧩 Scenario:**  
Your team wants to log all requests coming into the gateway, including headers and IP.  
**How would you implement this?**

**Best Approach:**

-   Implement a **`GlobalFilter`** that logs request info before routing.
    
-   Can also add MDC for tracing across services.
    

----------

### ✅ 8. **Different Auth for Different Services**

**🧩 Scenario:**  
Some services require JWT, others don’t. How would you handle that in Gateway?

**Answer:**

-   Use conditional filters:
    
    -   Apply `JwtAuthFilter` only to certain routes.
        
    -   Or add `FilterChain` logic that checks route ID before applying security logic.
        

----------

### ✅ 9. **Return Custom Error When Rate Limit Exceeded**

**🧩 Scenario:**  
You want to show a custom JSON response when a client exceeds rate limit.  
**Can Spring Gateway do this?**

**Answer:**

-   Not directly out of the box — you'd need:
    
    -   A custom **`RateLimiter` implementation** OR
        
    -   Handle response in a custom global error handler.
        

----------

### ✅ 10. **Expose Only Gateway to External World**

**🧩 Scenario:**  
You accidentally exposed a microservice on a public port. What security risks arise, and how do you prevent this?

**Key Points:**

-   Clients can bypass Gateway (JWT, rate limiting, fallback all skipped).
    
-   Always expose **only Gateway to the internet**.
    
-   Keep services behind firewall/internal network.
